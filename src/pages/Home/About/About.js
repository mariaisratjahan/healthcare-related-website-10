                <h3>From the moment you walk through the door you know Gymbase is a unique place</h3>
                <p>When we created Gym Base, we knew we wanted to be more than just a simple gym. Having worked in traditional gyms in the past, we knew we needed to create a concept that would provide our members with the most effective tools for success. This meant we needed to offer a wide range of classes both for children and adults.
This also meant we needed to provide a learning environment run by experienced and successful coaches. However, our most important goal was to create a welcoming atmosphere and community in which everyone feels a sense of belonging.</p>
